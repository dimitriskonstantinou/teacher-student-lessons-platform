Developed a web platform for managing students, teachers, and admins within an educational environment. 
- Implemented role-based authentication (admin, teacher, student) with dynamic dashboards per 
role.
- Admins can create and delete courses; teachers are assigned courses; students can view enrolled 
classes.
- Built using Flask, MySQL, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap 5, and Python session management.
